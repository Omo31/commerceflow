## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming light-blue (#64B5F6), inspired by themes of trust, efficiency, and digital communication.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), a desaturated version of the primary to provide a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted-green (#81C784), analogous to the primary hue but providing a refreshing contrast to draw attention to key elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets.
- All features should be scrollable both vertically and horizontally, and pagination should be implemented for long lists of data.
- Consistent use of a minimalist icon set for navigation and actions.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience.
